Welcome to the most exciting and innovative platform to build your blockchain application on **ETM/P Blockchain**. Blockchain technology is poised to revolutionise the way the digital world handles data and does business. Be a part of this revolution and get a head start with decentralised application development on ETM/P.

This page will act as your guide into the **ETM/P Ecosystem**. You'll find links to some useful resources and websites to get you up and started with building on ETM/P in particular and Blockchain in general. Feel free to reach out to us on Telegram/Discord.

## **Developer Quick Start**

If you're an Ethereum Developer, you're already a ETM/P developer.
All the tools you're familiar with are supported on ETM/P out of the box: Truffle, Remix, Web3js.
Switch over to ETM/P's RPC and get started!

- Setup [Metamask Wallet](/docs/develop/metamask/overview)

- Deploy your Contracts on ETM/P
    
    - [Using Remix](/docs/develop/remix)
    - [Using Truffle](/docs/develop/truffle)
    - [Using Hardhat](/docs/develop/hardhat)
    
- Connecting to ETM/P [with RPC](https://etm.network/docs/develop/metamask/config-etm3-on-metamask) by adding ETM/P on Metamask.

  Note that same RPC can be used with web3js.

    ```jsx
    // Javascript
  
    const Web3 = require('Web3')
  
    // Sign up for a free dedicated RPC URL at https://testnet-rpc.etm.network or other hosted node providers.
    const web3 = new Web3('https://testnet-rpc.etm.network')
  
    // web3 object is now connected with ETM/P's node
    ```

### **ü¶ï Already have a dApp?**

- **Migrating from Ethereum chain (or any EVM based chain for that matter)**

    Deploy all your smart contracts directly on ETM/P chain. You don't have to worry about the underlying architecture, as long as it is EVM compatible!
